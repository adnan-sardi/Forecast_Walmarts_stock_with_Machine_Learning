Walmart is a multinational company engaged in food retail sales.    
In this analysis we use the Walmart's stocks price from 01/2000 to 12/2019.

This is an analysis of the historical stock price of Walmart using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The purpose of this analysis is to predict future stock prices and identify trends and patterns in the data.

**Data**:

The data used for this analysis was obtained from Yahoo Finance and includes daily stock prices for Walmart over a period of several years. The data was preprocessed and normalized before being used to train and test the LSTM neural network.

**Methodology**:

The LSTM neural network was trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and trends in the historical stock prices. The network was then used to predict future stock prices and evaluate the performance of the model.
